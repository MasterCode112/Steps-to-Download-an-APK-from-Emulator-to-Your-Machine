You can easily pull an APK file from an emulator and save it to your machine using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Here's how:

You can easily pull an APK file from an emulator and save it to your machine using **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**. Here's how:

---

1. **Find the Package Name of the App**:
   - Use the following ADB command to list all installed packages and find the target app:
     ```bash
     adb shell pm list packages
     ```
   - If you know part of the app's name, you can filter the results. For example:
     ```bash
     adb shell pm list packages | grep <keyword>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     adb shell pm list packages | grep whatsapp
     ```

2. **Locate the APK Path**:
   - Once you have the app's package name, find its APK file's location:
     ```bash
     adb shell pm path <package_name>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     adb shell pm path com.example.app
     ```
   - This will return the APK file path. For example:
     ```
     package:/data/app/com.example.app-1/base.apk
     ```

3. **Pull the APK File to Your Machine**:
   - Use the `adb pull` command to download the APK file to your local machine:
     ```bash
     adb pull <apk_path> <destination_path>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     adb pull /data/app/com.example.app-1/base.apk ~/Downloads/
     ```
   - The APK will be saved in the specified destination path (e.g., `~/Downloads/`).

4. **Verify the APK File**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the APK to ensure it was successfully downloaded:
     ```bash
     ls ~/Downloads/
     ```

### **Permissions Issue Fix**
- If you get a **Permission Denied** error when trying to access the APK path (e.g., `/data/app/`), you may need **root access** on the emulator:
  ```bash
  adb root
  adb remount
  adb pull <apk_path> <destination_path>
  ```

- If your emulator is not rooted, you can try copying the APK to an accessible directory:
  ```bash
  adb shell
  cp /data/app/com.example.app-1/base.apk /sdcard/
  exit
  adb pull /sdcard/base.apk ~/Downloads/
  ```

---

### **Alternative Using File Explorer Apps**
If you're unable to use ADB or prefer a GUI method:
1. Install a file manager app (e.g., **ES File Explorer**) on the emulator.
2. Navigate to the app's APK location (e.g., `/data/app/` or `/sdcard/`).
3. Copy and move the APK to a directory accessible to you (e.g., `/sdcard/`).
4. Use `adb pull` to download it from `/sdcard/`.

By following these steps, you can successfully retrieve the APK from the emulator to your machine.
